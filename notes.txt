QUESTIONS:
* Why is atom_expr in python grammar not changed?
* Why did we not use transform_grammar_3?
* verilog grammar contains cycles after calling transform_grammar one,
  but not after calling it twice

  

TODO:
* update contains_cycle() functions to have a list; visited, so not to look at same nonterminal
  several times.
    * Also make it so that only contains_cycle() in Nonterminal class checks if it is the same?
* terminal/literal/string
    * now:  "\"" -> \"
    * want: "\"" -> "
    * using str.replace('\\', '') to to id now
* regular expression
    * now return a word from a list of fruits




Add a start and shortest parameter to generate functions
    * star is the nonterminal we started with to find cycels
    * shortest is a boolean value for knowin if we want
      recursion, repetiotion and optionalety.
Or another function for finding cycles in each class:
    def contains_cycle(self, nonterminal):
        if isinstance(self.args, Nonterminal):
            return self.args == nonterminal
        return self.args.contains_cycle(nonterminal)
