"retell" PhD


QUESTIONS:
* We dont transform the grammar using simple grammar transformations. We only remove cycles for the shortest terminal strings.
    - Do we then need to talk abput them in the thesis?
    - Is it still relatable to Vadim's PhD?

* Language consist of structure (syntax), and meaning (semantics). But we only get syntax from the grammar.
    - How will we add meaning to our generated examples?


* Where can spaces be added so it ends up correct?
    Nowhere...
    Has to be added as a Token in the grammar?
